This data comes from [this repo](https://github.com/alex/nyt-2020-election-scraper) and shows that the candidate leads over time. Interestingly, Biden took the lead in Georgia at `r ga_lead_time`.

Here is the number of timestamps for each state in the dataset:

```{r}
knitr::kable(timestamps_by_state, col.names=c("State", "Number of Timestamps"), "html") %>% 
  kable_styling(full_width = F)
```

Here is what the result looked like at the end of the vote tallies:

```{r}
